# shopping-list-c

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
A simple "shopping list" application that I am currently developing in order to practice what I have learned so far.

## UPDATE 1 (13 Dec, 2023):

As of the 13th of December, the project currently supports some basic functionality, such as creating an item, adding it to the list and displaying the list in a formatted way. In future iterations, my intention is to modify items on the list, sort the list, etc.

## UPDATE 2 (14 Dec, 2023):

Added a few more features such as a menu with some simple options. Also added some terminal colours as well as some functionalities such as adding new items to an already created list.
