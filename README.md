# shopping-list-c

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
A simple "shopping list" application that I am currently developing in order to practice what I have learned so far.

## UPDATE 1 (13 Dec, 2023):

As of the 13th of December, the project currently supports some basic functionality, such as creating an item, adding it to the list and displaying the list in a formatted way. In future iterations, my intention is to modify items on the list, sort the list, etc.

## UPDATE 2 (14 Dec, 2023):

Added a few more features such as a menu with some simple options. Also added some terminal colours as well as some functionalities such as adding new items to an already created list. 

## UPDATE 3 (14 Dec, 2023):

Also added the option to save the file. The next step is finding a way to read a list from a file and actually being able to modify it. I don't know if I have the necessary knowledge to do it, though. 

The project has reached a stage where I am satisfied with it. I canno say it is a "good project" But I think I was able to apply a lot of what I have been learning. Also, I am extremely happy that I could make something at least "readable" (at least to me LOL), because in the past, all my code was a complete mess.

I might still try to add some functionality to order the items by name, amount or something like that. But I know I have to move on and learn other things.
